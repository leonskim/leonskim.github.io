tagline = "Software developer, probably."

A guy who sets high standards, only to occasionally spiral into existential dread when expectations and reality refuse to align. Passionate about eating, drinking, and powerliftingâ€”though always with an emphasis on lifting pretty. A connoisseur of fragrant things, an unapologetic lover of the open road, and someone who somehow functions on minimal sleep. Proud caretaker of three indoor cats and unofficial landlord to a legion of outdoor ones.
